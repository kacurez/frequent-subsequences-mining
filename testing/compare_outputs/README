COMPARE.PY
a python skript which verfies the correctness of ouputs of the programs.
The programs executables must be in the same directory as the script with names: prefixspan and spade.

The script takes input arguments as file containing the name of the teste data set and a list of support thresholds separated by space, for example see input or input2 files. The  files with .data extension represent data sets.

If the ouputs of the programs are different then the script prints which seqeunces are missing in a specified output of the program program. Additionaly it prints the number of ouput sequences  for each program run.
