//*********************PREFIXSPAN HELP**********************************
usage: ./prefixspan <filename> <support_threshold> [--show-database] [--show-patterns]
filename - name of the data set(.data)
support_threshold - support thershold as absolute number
--show-database - prints an original database to stderr without infrequent 1-sequences 
--show-patterns - prints comple set of frequent sequences to stderr

to stdout the program prints a time in seconds in which the algorithm run. If --show-database option is on then it also comprehends the time of the print


./build/testdata directory contains the test datasets
table1db.data is a sample database used by author in the prefixspan paper which proposes the algorithm.


HAVE A FUN:)
